# Token-Based Vending Machine Using 8051 Microcontroller

This project implements a vending machine prototype designed to dispense snacks using a token-based system. The vending machine is controlled by an 8051 microcontroller, with fully developed hardware and software components.

## Features
- **Coin Detection**: IR sensors to detect token insertion.
- **User Interface**: LCD display for messages and item information.
- **Snack Dispensing**: Relays control the motor mechanism for dispensing items.
- **Wireless Communication**: HC-05 Bluetooth module for serial communication.
- **Assembly Code**: All functionality is implemented in 8051 assembly language.
- **Hardware Integration**: Fully developed and tested hardware setup.

## Components Used
- **8051 Microcontroller**
- **IR Sensors** for token detection
- **LCD Module** for user interaction
- **Relays and Motors** for snack dispensing
- **HC-05 Bluetooth Module** for wireless communication

## How It Works
1. Insert a token to start the vending process (detected by IR sensors).
2. The LCD displays the available snack options and status.
3. Upon successful validation, the corresponding snack is dispensed via the motor-controlled mechanism.
4. Optional wireless communication through the HC-05 module for external control or monitoring.

## Code Structure
- The code is written in **8051 Assembly Language**.
- Organized to handle IR sensor input, LCD initialization, motor control, and Bluetooth communication.

## Simulation
- The system was simulated using **Proteus** software to verify functionality before hardware implementation.

## Future Enhancements
- Adding multiple payment options like RFID or mobile app integration.
- Expanding snack variety and implementing inventory management.
