# 🛠️ Token-Based Vending Machine Using 8051 Microcontroller

This project implements a vending machine prototype designed to dispense snacks using a token-based system. The vending machine is controlled by an 8051 microcontroller, with fully developed hardware and software components.

## ✨ Features
- 🎯 **Coin Detection**: IR sensors to detect token insertion.
- 💡 **User Interface**: LCD display for messages and item information.
- 🍫 **Snack Dispensing**: Relays control the motor mechanism for dispensing items.
- 📡 **Wireless Communication**: HC-05 Bluetooth module for serial communication.
- 🖥️ **Assembly Code**: All functionality is implemented in 8051 assembly language.
- 🔧 **Hardware Integration**: Fully developed and tested hardware setup.

## 🔩 Components Used
- 🧠 **8051 Microcontroller**
- 🔎 **IR Sensors** for token detection
- 🖥️ **LCD Module** for user interaction
- ⚙️ **Relays and Motors** for snack dispensing
- 📶 **HC-05 Bluetooth Module** for wireless communication

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. 🪙 Insert a token to start the vending process (detected by IR sensors).
2. 📃 The LCD displays the available snack options and status.
3. ✅ Upon successful validation, the corresponding snack is dispensed via the motor-controlled mechanism.
4. 📡 Optional wireless communication through the HC-05 module for external control or monitoring.

## 🖋️ Code Structure
- 🛠️ The code is written in **8051 Assembly Language**.
- 📁 Organized to handle IR sensor input, LCD initialization, motor control, and Bluetooth communication.

## 🧪 Simulation
- The system was simulated using **Proteus** software to verify functionality before hardware implementation.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- 💳 Adding multiple payment options like RFID or mobile app integration.
- 🍽️ Expanding snack variety and implementing inventory management.
